#+begin_quote
  /"The slow blade penetrates the shield."/ *-- Gurney
  Hallack*[fn::Gurney Hallack is a character in the Dune universe, created by
Frank Herbert. He was the weapons master for House Atreides. He is also an
excellent topic for a lengthy footnote.]
#+end_quote

Footnote tab opens when cursor is hovered over the bottom part of the
browser window, and should close when the mouse hovers out of the region.
The tab will also open if a numerical-superscript citation link is clicked.
Hovering over citation links in main body will draw a white highlighted box
around the relevant footnote. Test this in the following:

- Proposition A[fn:pA]
- Proposition B[fn:pB]
- Statement C[fn:pC]

#+begin_quote
  if Proposition A[fn:pA] and Proposition B[fn:pB] are true, then statement C[fn:pC] follows.
#+end_quote

Clicking on the same citation link twice consecutively will collapse the
footnote tab.

  Check out this clickable branching tree below:
** {{tree}} Level 2 tree
   Preamble text for level 2 /tree/
*** Tree branch A
    - Branch A leaf AA with table
      | X | Y |
      |---+---|
      | 0 | 0 |
      | 1 | 2 |
    - Branch A leaf AB
*** Tree branch B {{leaf}} optional leaf text
    - Branch B leaf BA
    - Branch B leaf BB[fn:branch]
    - Branch B leaf BC
    =Verbatim postamble text for level 2 tree=

** {{endtree}} optional end of tree heading (this heading will be deleted in =html= dump)
Pretty cool collapse eh?
** Subsection explaining how to use =HTML= =treeview=

It was created by using the following text within the =org= file:

#+begin_src text
 ** {{tree}} Level 2 tree
   Preamble text for level 2 /tree/
 *** Tree branch A
    - Branch A leaf AA with table
      | X | Y |
      |---+---|
      | 0 | 0 |
      | 1 | 2 |
    - Branch A leaf AB
 *** Tree branch B {{leaf}} optional leaf text
    - Branch B leaf BA
    - Branch B leaf BB[fn:branch]
    - Branch B leaf BC
    =Verbatim postamble text for level 2 tree=
 ** {{endtree}} optional end of tree heading (this heading will be deleted in =html= dump)
Pretty cool collapse eh?
#+end_src

On top of that, the function [[elisp:org-html-w-treeview]] defined in
[[file:hover_preview_and_treeview_html.el]][fn:el] will copy the contents into a
temporary buffer, search for occurrences of ={{tree}}= text string, and
then perform some =#+HTML:= inserts, and then eventually calling =org='s
=HTML= export functions. This can be easily turned into a publishing
function. Just write to a temporary file, publish using [[elisp:
org-html-publish-to-html]], and then delete the temporary file. The source
=org= file contains startup code in a preamble section with a =:noexport:=
tag that generates this =html= document.

[fn:1] Footnote 1 text. The hungry fox jumped over the lazy dog.
[fn:css] This is a style file heavily seeded by the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/][worg]] website, which is
a community-run wiki for all things org-mode related. I use those tutorials
extensively. Also another great lengthy footnote opportunity.
[fn:js] =Javascript= code to update highlighted sections in the table of
contents. Also contains behavior for footnotes.
[fn:el] =emacs-lisp= functions to handle the hover-image span preview, as
well as =HTML= =treeview= stuff.
[fn:branch] A footnote cited from within a branch for the treeview structure in
[[id:13d143ac-ae89-4ce9-9170-6f61dfe427a6][Section 2]].
[fn:pA] All swans are white.
[fn:pB] Swans are the only birds on this island.
[fn:pC] There are only white birds on this island.
